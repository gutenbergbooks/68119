<p class="p4 noi"><span class="smcap">Men and Women of Iowa</span>:</p>
</div>

<p>I am glad indeed to see you and to
speak to you in this thriving city of your
great and prosperous State. I believe
with all my heart in the people of Iowa, for
I think that you are good, typical Americans,
and that among you there has been
developed to a very high degree that body<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
of characteristics which we like to regard
as distinctively American.</p>

<p>During the last few years we of the
United States have been forced to consider
very seriously certain economic problems.
We have made a beginning in the attempt
to deal with the relations of the National
Government—that is, with the relations of
the people of the country—to the huge and
wealthy corporations, controlled for the
most part by a few very rich men, which
are engaged in interstate business—especially<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
the great railway corporations.
You know my views on this matter. You
know that I believe that the National Government,
in the interests of the people,
should assume much the same supervision
and control over the management of the
interstate common carriers that it now
exercises over the national banks. You
know furthermore that I believe that this
supervision and control should be exercised
in a spirit of rigid fairness toward
the corporations, exacting justice from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
them on behalf of the people but giving
them justice in return.</p>

<p>Recently I have been reading the work
of the eminent Italian scholar Ferrero on
the history of the Roman Republic, when
the life of the Roman state had become
that of a complex and luxurious industrial
civilization. I am happy to say that the
differences between that civilization and
our own are more striking than the resemblances;
and there is no warrant for our
being drawn into any pessimistic comparison<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
between the two civilizations. But
there is every reason why we should study
carefully the past in order to draw from it
lessons for use in the present. One of the
most striking features of the years which
saw the downfall of the Roman Republic
was the fact that the political life of Rome
became split between two camps, one containing
the rich who wished to exploit the
poor, and the other the poor who wished
to plunder the rich. Naturally, under
such circumstances, the public man who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
was for the moment successful tended to
be either a violent reactionary or a violent
demagogue. Any such condition of political
life is as hopelessly unhealthy now as it
was then. I believe so implicitly in the
future of our people, because I believe
that the average American citizen will no
more tolerate government by a mob than
he will tolerate government by a plutocracy;
that he desires to see justice done
to and justice exacted from rich man and
poor man alike. We are not trying to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
favor any man at the expense of his fellows.
We are trying to shape things so that as
far as possible each man shall have a fair
chance in life; so that he shall have, so
far as by law this can be accomplished, the
chance to show the stuff that there is in
him. We have no intention of trying to
work for the impossible and undesirable
end of giving to the lazy, the thriftless,
the weak, and the vicious, the reward that
belongs to, and in the long run can only
come to, the hard working, the thrifty, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
resolute, and the honest. But we do wish
to see that the necessary struggle in life
shall be carried on under genuinely democratic
conditions; that, so far as human
action can safely provide it, there shall be
an approximately fair start; that there
shall be no oppression of the weak, and
that no man shall be permitted to acquire
or to use a vast fortune by methods or in
ways that are tortuous and dishonest.</p>

<p>Therefore we need wise laws, and we
need to have them resolutely administered.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
We can get such laws and such administration
only if the people are alive to their
interests. The other day I listened to an
admirable sermon by Bishop Johnston, of
western Texas. His theme was that the
vital element in judging any man should
be his conduct, and neither his position
nor his pretensions; and, furthermore, that
freedom could only stay with a people
which has the habit of self-mastery. As he
said, the price of liberty is not only eternal
vigilance, but eternal virtue; and I may add,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
eternal common sense. Each man here
knows that he himself has been able to use
his freedom to advantage only provided
that he could master himself, that he could
control his own passions and direct his
own faculties. Each of you fathers and
mothers here knows that if your sons are to
do well in the world they must know how
to master themselves. Every man must
have a master; if he is not his own master,
then somebody else will be. This is just
as true of public life as of private life. If<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
we can not master ourselves, control ourselves,
then sooner or later we shall have
to submit to outside control; for there
must be control somewhere.</p>

<p>One way of exercising such control is
through the laws of the land. Ours is a
government of liberty, but it is a government
of that orderly liberty which comes by
and through the honest enforcement of and
obedience to the law. At intervals during
the last few months the appeal has been
made to me not to enforce the law against<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
certain wrongdoers of great wealth because
to do so would interfere with the
business prosperity of the country. Under
the effects of that kind of fright which when
sufficiently acute we call panic, this appeal
has been made to me even by men who
ordinarily behave as decent citizens. One
newspaper which has itself strongly advanced
this view gave prominence to the
statement of a certain man of great wealth
to the effect that the so-called financial
weakness “was due entirely to the admitted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
intention of President Roosevelt to
punish the large moneyed interests which
had transgressed the laws.” I do not
admit that this has been the main cause of
any business troubles we have had; but it
is possible that it has been a contributory
cause. If so, friends, as far as I am concerned
it must be accepted as a disagreeable
but unavoidable feature in a course of
policy which as long as I am President
will not be changed. In any great movement
for righteousness, where the forces of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
evil are strongly intrenched, it is unfortunately
inevitable that some unoffending
people should suffer in company with the
real offenders. This is not our fault.
It is the fault of those to whose deceptive
action these innocent people owe their false
position. A year or two ago certain representatives
of labor called upon me and in the
course of a very pleasant conversation told
me that they regarded me as “the friend
of labor.” I answered that I certainly
was, and that I would do everything in my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
power for the laboring man <em>except anything
that was wrong</em>. I have the same
answer to make to the business man. I
will do everything I can do to help
business conditions, except anything that
is wrong. And it would be not merely
wrong but infamous to fail to do all that can
be done to secure the punishment of those
wrongdoers whose deeds are peculiarly
reprehensible because they are not committed
under the stress of want. Whenever
a serious effort is made to cut out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
what is evil in our political life, whether
the effort takes the shape of warring
against the gross and sordid forms of evil
in some municipality, or whether it takes
the shape of trying to secure the honest
enforcement of the law as against very
powerful and wealthy people, there are
sure to be certain individuals who demand
that the movement stop because it may
hurt business. In each case the answer
must be that we earnestly hope and believe
that there will be no permanent damage to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
business from the movement, but that if
righteousness conflicts with the fancied
needs of business, then the latter must
go to the wall. We can not afford to substitute
any other test for that of guilt or
innocence, of wrongdoing or welldoing,
in judging any man. If a man does well,
if he acts honestly, he has nothing to fear
from this Administration. But so far as in
me lies the corrupt politician, great or
small, the private citizen who transgresses
the law—be he rich or poor—shall be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
brought before the impartial justice of a
court. Perhaps I am most anxious to get
at the politician who is corrupt, because he
betrays a great trust; but assuredly I shall
not spare his brother corruptionist who
shows himself a swindler in business life;
and, according to our power, crimes of
fraud and cunning shall be prosecuted as
relentlessly as crimes of brutality and
physical violence.</p>

<p>We need good laws and we need
above all things the hearty aid of good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
citizens in supporting and enforcing the
laws. Nevertheless, men and women of
this great State, men and women of the
Middle West, never forget that law and the
administration of law, important though
they are, must always occupy a wholly
secondary place as compared with the character
of the average citizen himself. On
this trip I shall speak to audiences in each
of which there will be many men who
fought in the civil war. You who wore
the blue and your brothers of the South<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
who wore the gray know that in war no
general no matter how good, no organization
no matter how perfect, can avail if the
average man in the ranks has not got the
fighting edge. We need the organization,
the preparation; we need the good general;
but we need most the fighting edge in the
individual soldier. So it is in private life.
We live in a rough, workaday world, and
we are yet a long way from the millennium.
We can not as a nation and we can
not as individuals afford to cultivate only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
the gentler, softer qualities. There must be
gentleness and tenderness—the strongest
men are gentle and tender—but there
must also be courage and strength. I
have a hearty sympathy with those who
believe in doing all that can be done for
peace; but I have no sympathy at all with
those who believe that in the world as it
now is we can afford to see the average
American citizen lose the qualities that in
their sum make up a good fighting man.
You men must be workers who work with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
all your heart and strength and mind at
your several tasks in life; and you must
also be able to fight at need. You women
have even higher and more difficult duties;
for I honor no man, not even the soldier
who fights for righteousness, quite as much
as I honor the good woman who does her
full duty as wife and mother. But if she
shirks her duty as wife and mother then
she stands on a par with the man who
refuses to work for himself and his family,
for those dependent upon him, and who in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
time of the nation’s need refuses to fight.
The man or woman who shirks his or her
duty occupies a contemptible position.
You here are the sons and daughters of
the pioneers. I preach to you no life of
ease. I preach to you the life of effort, the
life that finds its highest satisfaction in
doing well some work that is well worth
doing.</p>

<p>So much for what concerns every man
and every woman in this country. Now,
a word or two as to matters which are of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
peculiar interest to this region of our
country.</p>

<p>Since I have been President I have
traveled in every State of this Union, but
my traveling has been almost entirely on
railroads, save now and then by wagon or
on horseback. Now I have the chance
to try traveling by river; to go down the
greatest of our rivers, the Father of
Waters. A good many years ago when I
lived in the Northwest I traveled occasionally
on the Upper Missouri and its tributaries;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
but then we went in a flatboat and
did our own rowing and paddling and poling.
Now I am to try a steamboat. I am a
great believer in our railway system; and
the fact that I am very firm in my belief
as to the necessity of the Government
exercising a proper supervision and control
over the railroads does not in the least interfere
with the other fact that I greatly admire
the large majority of the men in all positions,
from the top to the bottom, who build
and run them. Yet, while of course I am<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
anxious to see these men, and therefore
the corporations they represent or serve,
achieve the fullest measure of legitimate
prosperity, nevertheless as this country
grows I feel that we can not have too
many highroads, and that in addition to
the iron highroads of our railway system
we should also utilize the great river highways
which have been given us by nature.
From a variety of causes these highways
have in many parts of the country been
almost abandoned. This is not healthy.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
Our people, and especially the representatives
of the people in the National Congress,
should give their most careful
attention to this subject. We should be
prepared to put the nation collectively back
of the movement to improve them for the
nation’s use. Our knowledge at this time
is not such as to permit me to go into
details, or to say definitely just what the
nation should do; but most assuredly our
great navigable rivers are national assets
just as much as our great seacoast harbors.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
Exactly as it is for the interest of all the
country that our great harbors should be
fitted to receive in safety the largest vessels
of the merchant fleets of the world, so
by deepening and otherwise our rivers
should be fitted to bear their part in the
movement of our merchandise; and this is
especially true of the Mississippi and its
tributaries, which drain the immense and
prosperous region which makes in very fact
the heart of our nation; the basin of the
Great Lakes being already united with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
basin of the Mississippi, and both regions
being identical in their products and interests.
Waterways are peculiarly fitted
for the transportation of the bulky commodities
which come from the soil or
under the soil; and no other part of our
country is as fruitful as is this in such
commodities.</p>

<p>You in Iowa have many manufacturing
centers, but you remain, and I hope you
will always remain, a great agricultural
State. I hope that the means of transporting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
your commodities to market will be
steadily improved; but this will be of no
use unless you keep producing the commodities,
and in the long run this will largely
depend upon your being able to keep on
the farm a high type of citizenship. The
effort must be to make farm life not only
remunerative but attractive, so that the best
young men and girls will feel inclined to
stay on the farm and not to go to the city.
Nothing is more important to this country
than the perpetuation of our system of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
medium-sized farms worked by their
owners. We do not want to see our
farmers sink to the condition of the peasants
of the Old World, barely able to live on their
small holdings, nor do we want to see their
places taken by wealthy men owning
enormous estates which they work purely
by tenants and hired servants.</p>

<p>At present the ordinary farmer holds
his own in the land as against any possible
representative of the landlord class of
farmer—that is, of the men who would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
own vast estates—because the ordinary
farmer unites his capital, his labor, and his
brains with the making of a permanent
family home, and thus can afford to hold
his land at a value at which it can not be
held by the capitalist, who would have to
run it by leasing it or by cultivating it at
arm’s length with hired labor. In other
words, the typical American farmer of to-day
gets his remuneration in part in the
shape of an independent home for his
family, and this gives him an advantage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
over an absentee landlord. Now, from
the standpoint of the nation as a whole it
is preeminently desirable to keep as one
of our chief American types the farmer, the
farm home maker, of the medium-sized
farm. This type of farm home is one of
our strongest political and social bulwarks.
Such a farm worked by the owner has
proved by experience the best place in
which to breed vigorous leaders alike
for country and city. It is a matter
of prime economic and civic importance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
to encourage this type of home-owning
farmer.</p>

<p>Therefore, we should strive in every
way to aid in the education of the farmer
for the farm, and should shape our school
system with this end in view; and so
vitally important is this that, in my opinion,
the Federal Government should cooperate
with the State governments to
secure the needed change and improvement
in our schools. It is significant that
both from Minnesota and Georgia there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
have come proposals in this direction in
the appearance of bills introduced into the
National Congress. The Congressional
land grant act of 1852 accomplished much
in establishing the agricultural colleges in
the several States, and therefore in preparing
to turn the system of educational
training for the young into channels at
once broader and more practicable—and
what I am saying about agricultural training
really applies to all industrial training.
But the colleges can not reach the masses,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
and it is essential that the masses should
be reached. Such agricultural high
schools as those in Minnesota and Nebraska
for farm boys and girls, such technical
high schools as are to be found, for
instance, in both St. Louis and Washington,
have by their success shown that it is
entirely feasible to carry in practical fashion
the fundamentals of industrial training
into the realms of our secondary schools.
At present there is a gap between our
primary schools in country and city and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
the industrial collegiate courses, which
must be closed, and if necessary the
Nation must help the State to close it.
Too often our present schools tend to put
altogether too great a premium upon mere
literary education, and therefore to train
away from the farm and the shop.</p>

<p>We should reverse this process. Specific
training of a practical kind should be
given to the boys and girls who when
men and women are to make up the backbone
of this nation by working in agriculture,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
in the mechanical industries, in arts
and trades; in short, who are to do the duty
that should always come first with all of
us, the duty of home-making and home-keeping.
Too narrow a literary education
is, for most men and women, not a real
education at all; for a real education
should fit people primarily for the industrial
and home-making employments in
which they must employ the bulk of their
activities. Our country offers unparalleled
opportunities for domestic and social<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
advancement, for social and economic
leadership in the world. Our greatest
national asset is to be found in the children.
They need to be trained to high
ideals of everyday living, and to high
efficiency in their respective vocations; we
can not afford to have them trained otherwise,
and the nation should help the
States to achieve this end.</p>

<p>Now, men of Iowa, I want to say just
a word on a matter that concerns not the
States of the Mississippi Valley itself, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
the States west of them, the States of the
Great Plains and the Rocky Mountains.
Unfortunately, I am not able on this present
trip to visit those States, or I should speak
to their own people on the point to which
I now intend to allude; but after all anything
that affects a considerable number of
Americans who live under one set of conditions,
must be of moment to all other
Americans, for never forget, friends, that
in the long run we shall all go up or go
down together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span></p>

<p>The States of the high plains and of
the mountains have a peculiar claim upon
me, because for a number of years I lived
and worked in them, and I have that intimate
knowledge of their people that comes
under such conditions. In those States
there is need of a modification of the land
laws that have worked so well in the well-watered
fertile regions to the eastward,
such as those in which you here dwell.
The one object in all our land laws should
always be to favor the actual settler, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
actual home maker, who comes to dwell on
the land and there to bring up his children
to inherit it after him. The Government
should part with its title to the land only
to the actual home-maker—not to the
profit-maker, who does not care to make
a home. The land should be sold outright
only in quantities sufficient for decent
homes—not in huge areas to be held for
speculative purposes or used as ranches,
where those who do the actual work are
merely tenants or hired hands. No temporary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
prosperity of any class of men could
in the slightest degree atone for failure on
our part to shape the laws so that they may
work for the permanent good of the home-maker.
This is fundamental, gentlemen,
and is simply carrying out the idea upon
which I dwell in speaking to you of your
own farms here in Iowa. Now in many
States where the rainfall is light it is a
simple absurdity to expect any man to
live, still less to bring up a family, on one
hundred and sixty acres. Where we are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
able to introduce irrigation, the homestead
can be very much less in size—can, for
instance, be forty acres; and there is nothing
that Congress has done during the
past six years more important than the
enactment of the national irrigation law.
But where irrigation is not applicable and
the land can only be used for grazing, it
may be that you can not run more than
one steer to ten acres, and it is not necessary
to be much of a mathematician in
order to see that where such is the case a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
homestead of one hundred and sixty acres
will not go far toward the support of a
family. In consequence of this fact, homesteaders
do not take up the lands in the
tracts in question. They are left open for
anybody to graze upon that wishes to. The
result is that the men who use them moderately
and not with a view to exhausting their
resources are at the mercy of those who
care nothing for the future and simply
intend to skin the land in the present.
For instance, the small sheep farmer who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
has a home and who wishes that home to
pass on to his children improved in value
will naturally run his flock so that the
land will support it, not only to-day,
but ten years hence; but a big absentee
sheep owner, who has no home on the
land at all, but simply owns huge migratory
flocks of sheep, may well find it to
his profit to drive them over the small
sheep farmer’s range and eat it all out.
He can then drive his flocks on, whereas
the small man can not. Of course, to permit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
such a state of things is not only evil
for the small man, but is destructive of
the best interests of the country. Substantially
the same conditions obtain as
regards cattle. The custom has therefore
grown up of fencing great tracts of Government
land without warrant of law.
The men who fenced this land were
sometimes rich men, who, by fencing it,
kept out actual settlers and thereby
worked evil to the country. But in many
cases, whether they were large men or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
small men, their object was not to keep
out actual settlers, but to protect themselves
and their own industry by preventing
overgrazing of the range on the part
of reckless stock owners who had no
place in the permanent development of
the country and who were indifferent to
everything except the profits of the moment.
To permit the continuance of this
illegal fencing inevitably tended to very
grave abuses, and the Government has
therefore forced the fencers to take down<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
their fences. In doing this we have not
only obeyed and enforced the law, but we
have corrected many flagrant abuses.
Nevertheless, we have also caused hardship,
which, though unavoidable, I was
exceedingly unwilling to cause. In some
way or other we must provide for the
use of the public range under conditions
which shall inure primarily to the benefit
of the actual settlers on or near it, and
which shall prevent its being wasted.
This means that in some shape or way<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
the fencing of pasture land must be
permitted under restrictions which will
safeguard the rights of the actual settlers.
I desire to act as these actual settlers wish
to have me in this matter. I wish to find
out their needs and desires and then to try
to put them into effect. But they must take
trouble, must look ahead to their own ultimate
and real good, must insist upon being
really represented by their public men, if
we are to have a good result. A little
while ago I received a very manly and sensible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
letter from one of the prominent members
of the Laramie County, Wyo., Cattle
and Horse Growers’ Association. My correspondent
remarked incidentally in his
letter, “I am a small ranchman, and have
to plow and pitch hay myself,” and then
went on to say that the great majority of
their people had complied with the governmental
order, had removed their fences
and sold their cattle, but that they must
get some kind of a lease law which
would permit them to graze their stock<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
under proper conditions or else it would
be ruinous to them to continue in
the business. The thing I have most at
heart as regards this subject is to do whatever
will be of permanent benefit to just
exactly the people for whom this correspondent
of mine spoke—the small ranchmen
who have to plow and pitch hay themselves.
All I want to do is to find out what
will be to their real benefit, for that is certain
to be to the benefit of the country as a
whole. It may be that we can secure their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
interests best by permitting all homesteaders
in the dry country to inclose, individually or
a certain number of them together, big tracts
of range for summer use, the tracts being
proportioned to the number of neighboring
homesteaders who wish to run their
cattle upon it. It may be that parts of the
range will only be valuable for companies
that can lease it and put large herds on it;
for the way properly to develop a region
is to put it to those uses to which it is best
adapted. The amount to be paid for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
leasing privilege is to me a matter of comparative
indifference. The Government
does not wish to make money out of the
range, but simply to provide for the necessary
supervision that will prevent its being
eaten out or exhausted; that is, that will
secure it undamaged as an asset for the
next generation, for the children of the
present home makers. Of course we must
also provide enough to pay the proper
share of the county taxes. I am not
wedded to any one plan, and I am<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
willing to combine several plans if
necessary. But the present system is
wrong, and I hope to see, in all the
States of the Great Plains and the
Rockies, the men like my correspondent
of the Laramie County Cattle and Horse
Growers’ Association, the small ranchmen
“who plow and pitch hay themselves,”
seriously take up this matter and make
their representatives in Congress understand
that there must be some solution, and
that this solution shall be one which will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
secure the greatest permanent well-being
to the actual settlers, the actual home
makers. I promise with all the strength
I have to cooperate toward this end.</p>
